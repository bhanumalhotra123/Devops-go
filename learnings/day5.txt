What is Jenkins?

Automation server

Github Server                           Jenkins servers
Code gets pushed    Trigger ---->         Continous Delivery Pipeline (To staging environment)
                                        Build test deploy
                                         Merge the code with main if TestHealthSuccess
code merged?

Releaseto production ! On the time we want

Once it is in production --> We hit the operation phase in devops cycle where users are using the application.(Can handle scaling?)

Then monitoring(performance, transactions,load, average errs etc)


Again planning phase as per data insights we get from monitoring.

Then coding > Building > Test > Release > Deploy  > Operate > Monitoring.

(all the steps in devops cycle are happening simultaneously)
