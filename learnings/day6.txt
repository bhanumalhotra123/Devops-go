Infrastructure as code

If we build the Infrastructure manualy that is by using GUI we won't  be any history of our infra so we can't roll back.


Say whenever there is a pull request we want to build, test and deploy the code on our staging environment.

Now let us say our staging env is on ec2

We can add a script to the pipeline so that when it reaches to the deploy stage it creates the ec2 for staging environment.

So a git repository will help, we can make changes to the scripts and have control on it.

Instead of using GUI, we will write the go code for our infrastructure.

We will use Pulumi

Pulumi is a multi-language infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage cloud infrastructure using several programming languages. 
Pulumi supports languages like Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, and .NET/C#.

Installed pulumi: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/clouds/aws/get-started/begin/
and exported access and secret access key for aws user.

pulumi new aws-go
for crating a new pulumi project

Whatever resources we build it has to be placed under pulumi.run 

First we created sg and rules for it, then a ssh key

here we need to understand how ssh keys works.

We have 2 keys public and private in our local, we give the public key which can only be used for encryption to the server.
Now anything we get from the server with encryption using public key we can decrypt it using our private key.
