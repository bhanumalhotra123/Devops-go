Continous Integration

We have our api code and we are coninously planning and adding code to it.

We may have multiple developers working on the code and regulary merge code into the main branch.

Now different engineers maybe working on different features but maybe making changes to same part of the code which may cause conflicts.

We want to find bugs and conflicts quicker to make the code better.

And once the changes are pushed to central repo, we work to resolve the conflicts.

Assume developers kept on working for long in isolation and then merged there will be alot of conflicts.

But if it is quicker we will be able to solve conflicts faster as well and bugs also don't pile up.

No accumulation of bugs and conflicts!!
