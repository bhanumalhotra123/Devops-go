Git and Github
https://github.com/signup

create a repository

do git init in your local
git status
git add (whatever you want to stage)
git commit -m"the_message"
git remote add origin http.//github.........url to the repository on github
git push origin main(or the branch you want to push)
git config --global credential.helper store (try pushing after running this command, it will ask you for username and token)
Once you enter your creds it will be saved in ~/.git-credentials



Now assume two engineers e1 and e2

e1 
git pull (we are on replica of main branch right now)
git branch feature_add_new_endpoint
git checkout feature_add_new_endpoint
we make changes to the code of server.go
git diff
git add server.go
git  commit -m"new endpoint added"
we are still in feature branch
git push origin feature_add_new_endpoint  (this will create a new branch in remote)

Now main branch doesn't have new endpoint but feature_add_new_endpoint have the new endpoint code 

Pull request 
base: main compare: feature_add_new_endpoint
Merged! Now main branch also have new endpoint code.

Now Engineer e2
clone the same repository
will make some changes in server.go
git branch feature_add_print_statement
add a new print statement
git add server.go
git commit -m"added print statement"
git push origin feature_add_print_statement
Now again a pull request and add we can add a reviewer
